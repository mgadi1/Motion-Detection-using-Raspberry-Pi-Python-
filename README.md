# Motion-Detection-using-Raspberry-Pi-Python
## Internet of things project.
#### Using python, we are detecting the number of pixels changing in a particular amount of time. If the change is higher, then the user is notified about the motion. We can customize the number of pixels at that which the motion should be detected.
